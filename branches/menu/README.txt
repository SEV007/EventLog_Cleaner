EventLog_Cleaner is a small script which uses windows embedded (Out-of-the-Box) to clean the event logs.
Event logs are very important part of the system, but many of the users don't even know how to read them,
in this case they only slows down your systems, since the logs increase in size/rows in time and makes
harder the work of the OS finding the last line and writing more and more to the logs. I noticed incredible
speed up by my system when first wrote the script and tested it and I am still using it, as my friends do
so if you are experiencing troubles with the performance give it a try.

Compatibility: Windows Vista/7/8/10
Tested: Windows 7/8/10

There is still a lot of work over this script and probably a GUI, but for now thats what I have done.

Recommendations:
Re-Run the script once in a while since while you install new software it may create new event logs
which may not appear in the list for cleaning.
